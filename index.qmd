## About the ToT

We are pleased to announce that the ASAP AI/ML Program is hosting a comprehensive Training of Trainers (ToT) series to establish strong mathematical foundations in artificial intelligence and machine learning education.

Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning represent the convergence of centuries of mathematical development across multiple disciplines. What appears as technological magic is fundamentally built upon four mathematical pillars: Linear Algebra, Calculus, Probability & Statistics, and Optimization. This expert-led series explores how these foundational disciplines work in concert to create intelligent systems, moving beyond superficial code implementation to deep conceptual understanding. Through interactive demonstrations, mathematical derivations, real-world applications, and pedagogical strategies, we will equip trainers to deliver the revamped AI/ML curriculum with scientific rigor and mathematical integrity.
